To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun dev
```

What was done:
1) implemented backend server with simple custom router
2) implemented database migrations
3) implemented frontend app that builds and serves with the same backend server
4) implemented basic LoginPage with storing current user in localStorage
5) implemented HomePage with list of accounts to chat with
6) implemented ChatPage with messages list and input

Comments:
All libraries except react and react-hook-form are new for me, so it took good amount of time to set them up together. Due to lack of time left, did only simple inline styling.

Thank you and looking forward for your feedback!
